# Image Captioning AI

This project generates captions for images using pre-trained models like VGG for image feature extraction and RNN or Transformer-based models for text generation.

## Features:
- Image feature extraction using pre-trained VGG model.
- Caption generation using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).
- Supports custom image uploads to generate captions.
